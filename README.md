This repo is for template for my projects.


## Installation

### Prerequisite: `pyenv`

`pyenv` simplifies Python version management, enabling you to seamlessly switch between 
Python versions for different project requirements.



https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer

On macOS you can use [brew](https://brew.sh), but you may need to grab the `--HEAD` version for the latest:

```bash
brew install pyenv --HEAD
```

or

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

And then you should check the local `.python-version` file or `.envrc` and install the correct version which will be the basis for the local virtual environment. If the `.python-version` exists you can run:

```bash
pyenv install
```

This will show a message like this if you already have the right version, and you can just respond with `N` (No) to cancel the re-install:

```bash
pyenv: ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6 already exists
continue with installation? (y/N) N
```

### Prerequisite: `direnv`

`direnv` streamlines environment variable management, allowing you to isolate 
project-specific configurations and dependencies within your development environment.

https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html

```bash
curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash
```

### Developer Setup

If you are a new developer to this package and need to develop, test, or build -- please run the following to create a developer-ready local Virtual Environment:

```bash
direnv allow
python --version
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
